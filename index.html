            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Fedor Bentsa, and I am from Moscow, Russia. This is my third year at Northeastern University in the United States, where I am studying Finance and Data Science. The picture you see is of me with my biggest passion - Motorsport. I have been involved in motorsport for over 13 years. Unfortunately, I had to stop racing when I moved to the United States, as my studies take up a lot of my time. Additionally, the sport is not as developed here as it is in Russia. Nevertheless, I still feel a deep sense of nostalgia for the sport.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, my team and I began participating in 12- and 24-hour marathons on various tracks across different cities in Russia. That year, we won two championships and became the top team in Russia, ranking 7th in the world. We were even invited to the grand final in Abu Dhabi, but, unfortunately, due to the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, the event was canceled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I am incredibly grateful that I had the chance to experience the thrill of motorsport (thank you to my mom), and I will always cherish the memories and the passion I developed for it.
            </p>
